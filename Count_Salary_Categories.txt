Table: Accounts

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| account_id  | int  |
| income      | int  |
+-------------+------+
account_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains information about the monthly income for one bank account.
 

Write a solution to calculate the number of bank accounts for each salary category. The salary categories are:

"Low Salary": All the salaries strictly less than $20000.
"Average Salary": All the salaries in the inclusive range [$20000, $50000].
"High Salary": All the salaries strictly greater than $50000.
The result table must contain all three categories. If there are no accounts in a category, return 0.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Accounts table:
+------------+--------+
| account_id | income |
+------------+--------+
| 3          | 108939 |
| 2          | 12747  |
| 8          | 87709  |
| 6          | 91796  |
+------------+--------+
Output: 
+----------------+----------------+
| category       | accounts_count |
+----------------+----------------+
| Low Salary     | 1              |
| Average Salary | 0              |
| High Salary    | 3              |
+----------------+----------------+
Explanation: 
Low Salary: Account 2.
Average Salary: No accounts.
High Salary: Accounts 3, 6, and 8.


Solution 1:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT 
    all_categories.category,
    COALESCE(categories.number_of_accounts, 0) AS accounts_count
FROM (
    SELECT 
        CASE
            WHEN income < 20000 THEN 'Low Salary'
            WHEN income BETWEEN 20000 AND 50000 THEN 'Average Salary'
            WHEN income > 50000 THEN 'High Salary'
        END AS category,
        COUNT(*) AS number_of_accounts
    FROM 
        accounts
    GROUP BY 
        category
) AS categories
RIGHT JOIN (
    SELECT 'Low Salary' AS category
    UNION
    SELECT 'Average Salary' AS category
    UNION
    SELECT 'High Salary' AS category
) AS all_categories
ON categories.category = all_categories.category;



Solution 2:

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT "Low Salary" AS category, SUM(income < 20000) AS accounts_count FROM Accounts
UNION ALL
SELECT "Average Salary" AS category, SUM(income BETWEEN 20000 AND 50000) AS accounts_count FROM Accounts
UNION ALL
SELECT "High Salary" AS category, SUM(income > 50000) AS accounts_count FROM Accounts;
